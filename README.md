# First Year Coursework
My first year "Introduction to Computer Programming" module semester two coursework. The programming task was to create a console application for booking a seat/s on a single train carriage. All the information is read into the program from text files. The user can book a seat based on certain preferences and if carriage is fully booked, they are put on a waiting list.

This repository is to show potential employers my programming ability and work have done in my university work.
